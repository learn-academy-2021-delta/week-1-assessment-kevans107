# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is the version control system that allows developers to work on multiple sections of code without overriding the main code. This allows developers to actively change code on separate branches or versions while maintaining the main code in the repository that allows continued operation of the code. GitHub is the website where developers can push up their coding to the main repository and other developers can access it. 

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that is maintained on your local system. It is self-contained, allowing developers to record their versions of code. These versions, or branches, gives developers the ability to go back to previous versions of code and delete, merge, and otherwise change code that can remain locally or be pushed up to the main repository. GitHub is the online database that allows developers to share their code with other developers to make edits on branches or merge code to the main code. 



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: <, >, <=, >=, or other entries that will return a true or false 

  Researched answer: Primitive boolean is a logical datatype that only returns either true or false. They are equality operators that compare two values to each other. Different outcomes depend on whether the developer uses loose equality or strict equality to comare two items. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a placeholder for an item in a line of code. For example, in a string for "hello" the index provides a placeholder for each of the letters in the string where h-0, e-1, l-2, l-3, and o-4. Understanding indexing allows you to manipulate a specific item within a line of code. A value is an input that is assigned by the developer to a variable.

  Researched answer: An index is a placeholder for each character in a string. Strings begin at the zero index, therefore characters start at 0 and count up from there. A value is an assigned datatype. There are six primitive types of values: numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.
  



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a pre-programmed function of code that allows developers to easily mutate the code without having to run long lines of code to get the same result. 

  Researched answer: A built-in method is an action that can be called on to perform a function. Built-in methods can be used to mutate or access parts of your code. Built-in methods can be accessed through the dot operator, name of the method, or open and close parentheses.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: In proper pair programming, there is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the developer who is inputting the code into the text editor, while the navigator is supporting the driver by overseeing the driver write the code while researching solutions to lines of code and looking for any errors in the lines of code as the driver types. The driver and navigator work together to build, change, and debug one project together. 

  Researched answer: Two developers work toegher only using one machine. One developer acts as the driver while the other serves as the navigator to oversee the lines of code that the driver manipulates. The navigator supports the driver by proofreading and spell checking the driver's code while also figure out how to build, edit, or debug the project. Pair programming often results in more efficient code produced in less time with fewer mistakes. It also provides an opportunity to share knowledge and provide mentorship. 



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The challenges and pair programming was a great hands-on way to start learning. It is only so helpful to sit and watch others code or review concepts. I really felt concepts starting to click when I was able to manipulate the code for myself or to have to walk my programming partner through a problem set. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: An iteration is when a function causes a line of code to perform repetitive task more than once. 

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function. It's considered 'higher order', because instead of using the six primative data types, it operates on functions. 

3. Jest: A Javascript Testing Framework that can be used for any javascript based project. It is an open source platform that allows developers to test projects.

4. Objects: Objects are a javascript data type. It can store collections and complex entities. The Object works like a container for a given value, but can be altered. 

5. Classes: Classes are a way to create objects and consolidate code to work on objects. Classes are considered special functions.
